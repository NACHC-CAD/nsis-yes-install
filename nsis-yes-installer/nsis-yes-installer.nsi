# This script creates the installer for the _YES Eclipse environment.  
# Documentation for the _YES Eclipse environment is available at:
# https://nachc-cad.github.io/fhir-to-omop/pages/navbar/how-tos/developer-how-tos/install-eclipse/InstallEclipse.html
#
# For this script to work you will need to install the EnVar plug in.  
# https://nsis.sourceforge.io/EnVar_plug-in 
#
# Documentation for the EnVar API is here:
# https://github.com/GsNSIS/EnVar
#
# Instructions for plugin install
# From: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/How_can_I_install_a_pluginÂ 
#
#   After downloading and unpacking a plugin one needs to accept the license agreement (residing in the "license.txt" file if applicable). 
#   Then the ".dll" files must be put into the "NSIS\Plugins[\platform]" subfolder and the ".nsh" file into the "NSIS\Include" subfolder.
#   NSIS v2 only supports ANSI plug-ins and they are stored in "NSIS\Plugins". 
#   NSIS v3 supports multiple targets and plugins are stored in subfolders under "NSIS\Plugins\".
#
# WriteEnvStr.nsh was downloaded from the following url (put the .nsh file in <NSIS>/Include folder):
# https://github.com/rasa/nsislib/blob/master/WriteEnvStr.nsh
